I learned how to apply basic firewall rules, which are essential for protecting Linux servers. Oasis Infobyte
As part of my Intern, I was assigned the second task of configuring a basic firewall using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) â€” a simple yet powerful tool for managing firewall rules in Linux systems. In this task, I focused on securing the system by allowing only SSH connections (for remote access) and blocking HTTP traffic (to restrict web server access). To begin, I installed UFW using the command: sudo apt install ufw After installation, I enabled UFW so it would start automatically with the system: sudo ufw enable Next, to allow secure remote login via SSH, I added the rule: sudo ufw allow ssh This opens port 22, which is used for SSH connections. To prevent any incoming HTTP traffic (commonly on port 80), I blocked it with:  sudo ufw deny http Finally, I verified the active rules using: sudo ufw status This confirmed that SSH was allowed, while HTTP was successfully blocked. Through this task, I learned how to apply basic firewall rules, which are essential for protecting Linux servers. Oasis Infobyte
